# GO-ProofOfStake-Blockchain
Proof Of Stake Blockchain written in GO

"In traditional Proof of Stake, a validator can be chosen as the winner even if they don’t propose a new block. Remember, Proof of Stake isn’t a definition, it’s a concept; there are lots of different implementations of Proof of Stake and like Proof of Work, each implementation has its own nuances"
